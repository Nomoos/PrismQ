# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Key Guidelines

### 1. Make Small Changes
- Make the smallest possible changes to accomplish the task
- Avoid unnecessary modifications to unrelated code
- Keep changes focused and surgical

### 2. Ask When Uncertain About Location
- If you cannot find a module or are unsure where to make changes, ask the user
- Do not guess or make assumptions about file locations
- Use clarification language when asking, for example:
  - "Could you please clarify which module should be modified?"
  - "I'd like to understand better where this change should be made."
  - "To ensure I make the correct changes, could you specify the file path?"

### 3. Always Ask When Uncertain
- When in doubt about any aspect of the task, ask the user for clarification
- Do not make assumptions that could lead to incorrect implementations
- Use clarification language in questions, for example:
  - "Could you please elaborate on the expected behavior?"
  - "I want to make sure I understand correctly - does this mean...?"
  - "To clarify, should the implementation include...?"
