1. **Visual Cues**: Add specific details for video production
2. **Sound Design Notes**: Music breaks are marked but more guidance needed
3. **Character Background**: Why is he being hunted?

### Low Priority
1. **Series Arc**: Consider overall story arc if this is episodic
2. **Title Optimization**: Current title unknown - needs compelling title

00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,839
This was the only way for the old man to

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:03,360
survive. [music] Because only by doing

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,960
this would the hunting dogs not dare to

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,120
bite him.

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,719
>> Although in this brief moment, the old

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,240
man quickly jumped into the river and

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,920
avoided the bullet shot by the enemy.

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,685
But unexpectedly, the cunning soldiers

9
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:18,880
[music] went straight to the riverbank

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,039
to guard.

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,400
At this time, the old man, due to

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,320
prolonged lack of oxygen, rose to the

13
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,880
surface of the water.

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,600
A red substance instantly appeared on

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,640
the surface of [music] the water.

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,320
However, the officer who saw this scene

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,000
not only stayed by the river, but even

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,600
sent soldiers to jump into the river.

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,280
But what no one expected at this time

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,960
was that this soldier had just swam to

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,559
the bottom of the river, and the old man

22
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,399
quietly reached behind him and greedily

23
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,760
absorbed [music] the oxygen offered to

24
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,760
him.

25
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,039
At this point, the soldier, following

26
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,239
his superiors [music] orders,

27
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,920
reluctantly jumped into the river. But

28
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,840
not long after, a large amount of red

29
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,199
substance [music] floated to the surface

30
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,200
again. And another soldier, seeing this

31
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,119
terrifying scene, hurriedly tried to row

32
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,760
the boat to the shore.

33
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,000
However, after [music] completing his

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,600
orders, he instantly showed an

35
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,360
expression of disbelief because the boat

36
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,960
was still moving, it wasn't until they

37
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,240
could clearly [music] see it, that they

38
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,600
realized that the old man was pushing

39
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,040
the boat to the shore underwater.

40
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,390
Although the old man used the bodies

41
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,000
[music] to block all the ambushes and

42
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,439
successfully escaped the enemy's

43
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,280
encirclement. Unfortunately, the old

44
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,200
man's dog fell into their hands and this

45
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,880
gave the enemy a tracker. Later, when

46
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,159
the [music] old man arrived at a gas

47
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,159
station, his dog suddenly ran out. But

48
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,491
before the old man could rejoice,

49
00:01:43,491 --> 00:01:44,799
[music] he noticed that something was

50
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,720
tied to the dog. The tremendous impact

51
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,399
caused the old man to faint instantly.

52
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,640
It wasn't until he woke up again.

53
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,971
That the old man, after struggling

54
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:55,600
[music] for a short while, completely

55
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,360
lost all movement. To ensure everything

56
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,280
was foolproof, the enemy stayed in place

57
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,200
for 2 and 1/2 hours before they finally

58
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,280
left. Satisfied. However, after the

59
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,880
enemy had walked far away, [music] the

60
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,719
old man suddenly revived. This time,

61
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,640
will he manage to escape again by luck?

62
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,080
Please stay tuned to find out what

63
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,346
happens

64
00:02:10,346 --> 00:02:12,366
