## Overview

Production-ready agentic AI pipeline using LangGraph for multimodal content generation (Text → Image → Audio → Video)

## Key Features

- **LangGraph Workflow Orchestration** - Uses LangGraph for workflow orchestration
- **Multi-modal Content Generation** - Supports text, image, audio, and video generation
- **Sequential Approach** - Similar sequential approach to PrismQ

## Technology Stack

- **Primary Language:** Jupyter Notebook
- **Workflow Engine:** LangGraph
- **Pipeline:** Text → Image → Audio → Video

## Comparison to PrismQ

### Strengths
- ✅ **Similar multi-format pipeline approach** - Implements a comprehensive pipeline like PrismQ
- ✅ **Sequential content enrichment** - Follows progressive enrichment model
- ✅ **LangGraph integration** - Modern workflow orchestration

### Limitations
- ❌ **No SEO optimization** - Lacks content optimization features
- ❌ **No publishing workflow** - Missing distribution capabilities
- ❌ **Smaller scope** - Less comprehensive than PrismQ's complete platform

## Relevance to PrismQ

This repository validates PrismQ's sequential enrichment approach. The use of LangGraph is particularly interesting and could be considered for PrismQ's workflow orchestration enhancement.

## Extractable Mechanics

1. **LangGraph Workflow System** - Graph-based workflow orchestration for multi-agent systems
2. **Sequential Pipeline Design** - Progressive content enrichment pattern
3. **Multi-modal Integration** - Techniques for combining different content formats

## Implementation Priority

**Medium** - LangGraph integration could enhance PrismQ's workflow visualization and orchestration capabilities (Phase 3 in roadmap).
