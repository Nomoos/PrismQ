## Overview

Interactive storytelling framework using LLMs to generate dynamic narratives along predefined, graph-based story paths

## Key Features

- **Graph-based Story Paths** - Structured narratives
- **LLM-driven Generation** - AI storytelling
- **Dynamic Narratives** - Adaptive content
- **Python Framework** - Extensible architecture

## Technology Stack

- **Primary Language:** Python
- **Topics:** ai, game-engine, gamebook, interactive-fiction, llm, narrative-generation, python, storytelling

## Comparison to PrismQ

### Strengths
- ✅ **LLM-driven narrative** - AI story generation
- ✅ **Python-based** - Compatible stack
- ✅ **Structured story paths** - Similar to state machine
- ✅ **Recent activity** - Active development

### Limitations
- ❌ **Gaming/interactive fiction** - Not content production
- ❌ **No audio/video pipeline** - Text only
- ❌ **No publishing workflow** - Missing distribution

## Extractable Mechanics

1. **Graph-based Story Paths** - Structured narrative progression
2. **LLM Narrative Generation** - Story creation patterns
3. **State Machine for Stories** - Path management

## Implementation Priority

**Medium** - Graph-based approach interesting for story mode (Phase 2), but gaming focus limits applicability.
