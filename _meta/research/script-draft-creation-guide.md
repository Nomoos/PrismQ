# Script Draft Creation Guide

## Overview

This research document defines the requirements, processes, and best practices for creating script drafts in the PrismQ content production workflow. A script draft is the first full narrative realization of an Idea, transforming structured outlines into natural, spoken-form content ready for review and refinement.

## Purpose

Script drafts serve as the foundation for all downstream content production:
- **Text Publishing**: Direct source for blog posts and articles
- **Audio Production**: Source material for voiceover and podcast narration
- **Video Production**: Narrative foundation for scene planning and visual storytelling

## Sequential Workflow Position

## What Script Drafts Need

### 1. Core Components

#### A. Narrative Foundation from Idea
**Required Inputs:**
- **Structured Outline**: Complete section breakdown from Idea/Outline module
- **Story Concept**: Core narrative hook and purpose from Idea/Model
- **Target Audience**: Demographics and platform specifications
- **Emotional Quality**: Intended tone and impact
- **Working Title**: Early title draft for context and direction

**Why These Matter:**
- Ensures script aligns with validated concept
- Maintains consistency with content strategy
- Provides clear direction for narrative voice
- Establishes emotional framework

#### B. Natural Spoken Form
**Key Requirements:**
- **Conversational Tone**: Write as if speaking to a friend
- **Natural Speech Patterns**: Include contractions, rhetorical questions, casual transitions
- **Rhythm and Flow**: Vary sentence length for natural cadence
- **Readability for Voice**: Easy to read aloud without stumbling

**Example Transformations:**
```
❌ Poor: "It is important to note that artificial intelligence has revolutionized..."
✅ Good: "Here's the thing about AI—it's completely changed how we..."

❌ Poor: "The aforementioned methodology demonstrates significant efficacy..."
✅ Good: "So that approach we talked about? It actually works really well."
```

#### C. Story Structure
**Essential Elements:**
1. **Opening Hook** (first 30 seconds)
   - Capture attention immediately
   - State the promise or question
   - Create curiosity gap

2. **Context Setting** (30-90 seconds)
   - Establish relevance
   - Connect to audience experience
   - Preview value proposition

3. **Main Content** (bulk of script)
   - Clear narrative progression
   - Logical section transitions
   - Supporting examples and evidence
   - Emotional beats and pacing

4. **Resolution/Conclusion** (final 30-60 seconds)
   - Satisfy the opening promise
   - Provide actionable takeaway
   - Memorable closing statement

5. **Call to Action** (final 15-30 seconds)
   - Clear next step
   - Platform-appropriate engagement request

#### D. Platform Optimization

**For Blog/Article (Text-First):**
- Longer, more detailed explanations
- Can include technical depth
- Subheadings and structure for skimming
- SEO considerations in language

**For Podcast (Audio-Primary):**
- More conversational asides
- Verbal signposting ("First...", "Now let's talk about...", "Here's the key...")
- Descriptions replace visual references
- Time references instead of location references ("coming up" vs "below")

**For Video (Audio + Visual):**
- References to on-screen elements
- Pause points for visual emphasis
- Shorter segments between visual transitions
- Interactive moments ("pause and think about...")

### 2. Quality Criteria for First Drafts

#### Minimum Viable Script Requirements
- [ ] **Completeness**: Full narrative from hook to conclusion (no gaps or TBDs)
- [ ] **Coherence**: Logical flow from one point to the next
- [ ] **Length**: Appropriate for target format and platform
  - Short-form video (TikTok/Reels): 300-600 words (1-2 minutes)
  - Medium-form (YouTube): 1,500-2,500 words (10-15 minutes)
  - Long-form (Blog/Podcast): 2,000-5,000 words (15-30 minutes)
- [ ] **Voice Consistency**: Maintains consistent tone and perspective
- [ ] **Audience Alignment**: Language and complexity match target audience

#### Quality Indicators (Nice to Have in Draft)
- Memorable opening hook
- Clear narrative arc
- Natural transitions between sections
- Emotional engagement moments
- Strong conclusion that delivers on promise

#### Acceptable Draft Imperfections
**Don't worry about these in the first draft:**
- Perfect grammar and punctuation (handled in Proofreading)
- Optimal pacing (handled in Script Improvements)
- Maximum impact phrasing (handled in Script Optimization)
- Technical accuracy details (verified in Script Review)
- SEO keyword optimization (handled in Publishing/SEO)

### 3. Creation Process: From Idea to Script Draft

#### Step 1: Gather Required Inputs (Prerequisites)
**From Idea Module:**
```
Required:
- Approved Idea with status: IDEA_OUTLINE → SKELETON → TITLE
- Complete outline from T/Idea/Outline
- Story concept and purpose from T/Idea/Model
- Target platform and audience specifications

Optional but Helpful:
- Emotional quality tags
- Similar content references
- Style guidelines
```

**From Title Draft:**
```
- Working title (doesn't need to be final)
- Title variations for testing
- Hook concepts explored in titles
```

#### Step 2: Establish Script Parameters
**Before Writing:**
1. **Target Length**: Based on platform and format
   - Estimate word count range
   - Consider typical reading/speaking pace (150 words/minute average)
   
2. **Narrative Structure**: Choose appropriate structure
   - Problem-Solution (educational content)
   - Story Arc (entertainment/narrative)
   - Thesis-Support-Conclusion (opinion/analysis)
   - Step-by-Step (tutorial/how-to)

3. **Voice and Tone**: Define voice characteristics
   - First person vs third person
   - Formal vs casual
   - Expert vs peer
   - Enthusiastic vs measured

#### Step 3: Create Structural Skeleton
**Section-by-Section Planning:**
```markdown
## Script Skeleton Template

### 1. Hook (Target: 30 seconds / 75 words)
- Opening statement/question
- Curiosity trigger
- Promise of value

### 2. Context/Setup (Target: 1 minute / 150 words)
- Why this matters
- Audience connection
- Preview of content

### 3. Main Content - Section A (Target: X minutes / Y words)
- Key Point 1
- Supporting detail
- Example/Evidence
- Transition

### 4. Main Content - Section B (...)
[Continue for each major section from outline]

### 5. Conclusion (Target: 45 seconds / 110 words)
- Summary of key points
- Answer to opening question
- Memorable closing

### 6. Call to Action (Target: 20 seconds / 50 words)
- Specific next step
- Platform-appropriate engagement
```

#### Step 4: First Draft - Write Through
**The "Vomit Draft" Approach:**
- **Goal**: Get complete narrative from start to finish
- **Method**: Write continuously without self-editing
- **Focus**: Natural voice and flow, not perfection
- **Timing**: 2-4 hours for most content (don't overthink)

**Writing Tips:**
1. Read your outline but don't look at it while writing sections
2. Speak the words out loud as you type
3. If you get stuck, skip to next section and come back
4. Mark uncertain areas with [CHECK] tags but keep writing
5. Don't stop to research—mark [RESEARCH NEEDED] and continue

**Example First Draft Snippet:**
```
So here's something wild that happened last week. I was scrolling through 
my feeds [CHECK: which platform?] and I saw this trend where everyone's 
suddenly talking about AI agents. Not like, the sci-fi kind. The real kind. 
The ones that are actually doing work right now.

And it got me thinking—how many people actually understand what these things 
can do? [RESEARCH NEEDED: current market penetration stats] Because from 
what I'm seeing, most folks are missing the real story here.

Let me break it down...
```

#### Step 5: Initial Self-Review
**Quick Pass (15-30 minutes):**
- [ ] Read entire script aloud
- [ ] Check for major logical gaps
- [ ] Verify hook and conclusion align
- [ ] Confirm all outline sections are covered
- [ ] Note sections that feel weak (don't fix yet)
- [ ] Mark any obvious factual errors

**Status Check:**
- If script feels >70% complete: Move to Script Review
- If script has major structural issues: Note them and move to Script Review anyway
- If script is missing entire sections: Fill the gaps, then move to Script Review

**Don't Over-Edit:**
The purpose of Script Draft is to get a complete first pass. Resist the urge to perfect it. The Review → Improvements → Optimization stages handle refinement.

## Relationship Between Components

### Title Draft → Script Draft Connection

**Title Draft Purpose:**
- Created during/after Idea Outline phase
- Provides working hook and direction
- Tests different angles before script writing
- Informs script's opening strategy

**How Title Draft Influences Script:**
1. **Opening Hook Alignment**: Script's first 30 seconds should deliver on title's promise
2. **Angle Consistency**: Title's perspective should match script's approach
3. **Keyword Integration**: Title concepts should appear naturally in script
4. **Emotional Tone**: Title's emotional quality guides script voice

**Example Flow:**
```
Title Draft Options:
1. "Why Your AI Agent Will Replace Your Intern (And That's Good)"
2. "The Silent Revolution: AI Agents at Work"
3. "I Replaced My Assistant with AI—Here's What Happened"

Selected: Option 3 (personal narrative angle)

Script Opening (aligned):
"Last Monday, I did something I've been avoiding for months. 
I let an AI agent handle everything my assistant usually does. 
And honestly? I'm not sure I can go back..."
```

### Script Draft → Next Stages

**To Script Review (T/Review):**
- Complete draft becomes source for multi-dimensional review
- Grammar, readability, tone, content accuracy checks
- Improvements suggested but not yet implemented

**To Script Improvements (T/Script/Improvements):**
- Review feedback gets implemented
- Structural refinements
- Clarity enhancements
- Flow optimization

**To Script Optimization (T/Script/Optimization):**
- Final polish for maximum impact
- Platform-specific adaptations
- Performance optimization
- Call-to-action refinement

## What to Do Next After Script Draft

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Save the Draft**
   - Store in `T/Script/FromIdeaAndTitle/` directory
   - Use clear naming: `{idea_id}_script_draft_v1.md`
   - Include metadata header

2. **Update Workflow Status**
   - Change content status from `IDEA_TITLE` to `SCRIPT_DRAFT`
   - Log completion timestamp
   - Note draft version number

3. **Prepare for Review**
   - Create review checklist
   - Gather any research materials used
   - Note specific areas where feedback is needed
   - Flag any [CHECK] or [RESEARCH NEEDED] items

4. **Enter Script Review Phase**
   - Route to T/Review modules for multi-dimensional review
   - Grammar and syntax check
   - Readability analysis
   - Tone consistency verification
   - Content accuracy validation

### Quality Gates Before Moving Forward

**Script Draft is Ready for Review When:**
- [ ] Complete narrative from hook to conclusion exists
- [ ] All sections from outline are addressed
- [ ] Script can be read aloud without major stumbling
- [ ] Length is appropriate for target platform
- [ ] Voice and tone are consistent throughout
- [ ] Hook and conclusion deliver on title's promise

**Script Draft Should Return to Idea Phase If:**
- Missing fundamental story concept
- Outline was insufficient or incomplete
- Target audience is unclear
- Platform requirements undefined
- Core narrative doesn't work

## Optimization and Fine-Tuning Strategies

### When to Optimize (After Draft, During Improvements Phase)

**Optimization Timing:**
- **Not during first draft**: Focus on completion, not perfection
- **During Script Improvements**: After review feedback is gathered
- **During Script Optimization**: Final polish before approval
- **After platform selection**: Platform-specific adaptations

### Optimization Dimensions

- **Breathing Room**: Slow down for complex concepts

**Example:**
```
Before (monotonous):
"The first thing you need to know is X. The second thing you need to 
know is Y. The third thing you need to know is Z."

After (varied pacing):
"Here's what you need to know. First: X. But here's where it gets 
interesting—Y changes everything. And then there's Z... which honestly, 
this is the part that surprised me most."
```

#### 2. **Emotional Engagement Optimization**
**Goal**: Create emotional connection and memorability

**Techniques:**
- **Personal Anecdotes**: Add relatable stories

2. **Return to Script Draft** (significant issues)
   - Structural problems
   - Missing critical sections
   - Misalignment with Idea

3. **Return to Idea Phase** (fundamental problems)
   - Core concept doesn't work
   - Outline was inadequate
   - Platform mismatch

## Best Practices and Guidelines

### Do's ✅

1. **Write in Natural Speaking Voice**
   - Read aloud as you write
   - Use contractions
   - Include conversational asides
   - Embrace casual transitions

2. **Focus on Completion First**
   - Get the full narrative down
   - Don't edit as you go
   - Mark issues for later
   - Maintain momentum

3. **Respect the Outline**
   - Cover all major sections
   - Follow logical structure

   - Deliver satisfying resolution

5. **Write for the Ear (Even for Text)**
   - Use rhythm and cadence
   - Create natural pauses
   - Avoid complex nested clauses
   - Test by reading aloud

### Don'ts ❌

1. **Don't Aim for Perfection in First Draft**
   - Perfectionism kills momentum
   - Revisions happen in later stages
   - Done is better than perfect for drafts

2. **Don't Write Without an Outline**
   - Outlines provide structure
   - Prevent rambling and tangents
   - Ensure complete coverage
   - Make writing faster, not slower

3. **Don't Ignore Platform Requirements**
   - Length matters for engagement
   - Format affects content style
   - Platform culture influences tone
   - Audience expectations vary

4. **Don't Over-Explain Technical Details**
   - Assume reasonable baseline knowledge
   - Provide enough context, not everything
   - Link to resources for deep dives
   - Trust your audience's intelligence

5. **Don't Skip the Call-to-Action**
   - Every script needs clear next step
   - Engagement requires explicit ask
   - Make action easy and specific
   - Don't assume audience knows what to do

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

#### Pitfall 1: "Writing for Reading Instead of Listening"
**Problem**: Text optimized for eyes, not ears
**Solution**: Read every sentence aloud; if it doesn't sound natural, rewrite

#### Pitfall 2: "Information Overload"
**Problem**: Trying to cover too much in one script
**Solution**: Ruthlessly prioritize; one clear message is better than three vague ones

#### Pitfall 3: "Burying the Lead"
**Problem**: Taking too long to get to the point
**Solution**: Hook should deliver value promise within 30 seconds

#### Pitfall 4: "Inconsistent Voice"
**Problem**: Tone or perspective shifts mid-script
**Solution**: Define voice parameters before writing; review for consistency

#### Pitfall 5: "Weak Conclusion"
**Problem**: Script fizzles out instead of landing strongly
**Solution**: Write conclusion second (after hook); ensure it delivers on promise

## Conclusion

Script drafts are the critical transformation point where structured ideas become narrative reality. By following this guide:

1. **Start with Strong Foundation**: Complete Idea outline and working title
2. **Write for Voice**: Natural, conversational, easy to speak
3. **Structure for Engagement**: Hook → Context → Content → Conclusion → CTA
4. **Accept Imperfection**: First drafts are meant to be revised
5. **Follow the Process**: Draft → Review → Improvements → Optimization
6. **Optimize for Platform**: Adapt for specific publication channels
7. **Measure and Refine**: Use review feedback to continuously improve

The goal of Script Draft creation is not perfection—it's completion. A finished draft that can be reviewed and improved is infinitely more valuable than a perfect first paragraph that never progresses.

Focus on getting the narrative from start to finish in a natural, engaging voice. The refinement comes in the subsequent stages of the workflow.
