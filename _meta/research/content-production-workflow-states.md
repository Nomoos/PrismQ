# Content Production Workflow States

## Overview

This document defines the complete workflow states for content production in PrismQ, from initial concept to final publication. Each stage represents a distinct phase in the content creation pipeline, with clear purposes and traditional publishing equivalents.

## Workflow Stages

The content production workflow consists of 14 sequential stages, each building upon the previous:

## Workflow Characteristics

### Sequential Nature
The workflow follows a natural progression from concept to publication. While some stages may overlap or iterate, the general flow moves forward through these phases.

### Iteration Points
Certain stages commonly trigger iteration:
- **ScriptReview** may loop back to **Script**
- **PostProcessing** may return to **VideoAssembly**
- **Publishing & Distribution** may inform future **IdeaInspiration**

### Quality Gates
Key quality checkpoints occur at:
- **Proofreading** (linguistic quality)
- **ScriptReview** (narrative quality)
- **PostProcessing** (production quality)

### Platform Adaptations
Different platforms may emphasize different stages:
- **YouTube**: Strong focus on Publishing & Distribution metadata
- **TikTok**: Emphasis on KeyframeGeneration and quick VideoAssembly
- **Podcast**: VoiceoverProduction and TranscriptAlignment are critical

## Integration with PrismQ Systems

### IdeaInspiration Module
The first stage directly aligns with the existing **IdeaInspiration** module, which:
- Collects ideas from 24+ sources
- Classifies content into 8 categories
- Scores content 0-100 for engagement potential
- Feeds into the Idea stage for development

### Workflow Automation Opportunities
- Automated transitions between stages
- Quality gate validation
- Progress tracking and reporting
- Time estimation per stage
- Resource allocation optimization

### Data Model Extensions
Each workflow state could track:
- **Status**: Not Started, In Progress, Complete, Blocked
- **Timestamps**: Start time, end time, duration
- **Assignees**: Human or automated agents
- **Artifacts**: Files, assets, metadata generated
- **Quality Metrics**: Stage-specific KPIs

## Comparison to Traditional Publishing

| Aspect | Traditional Publishing | PrismQ Video Production |
|--------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **Linear Flow** | Author → Editor → Designer → Publisher | IdeaInspiration → Script → Production → Distribution |
| **Iterations** | Multiple editing rounds | Multiple review and enhancement stages |
| **Production** | Physical printing | Digital video assembly |
| **Distribution** | Bookstores, libraries | YouTube, TikTok, social platforms |
| **Optimization** | Cover design, blurbs | Metadata, thumbnails, timing |
| **Feedback Loop** | Reviews, sales data | Analytics, engagement metrics |

## Future Considerations

### Automation Potential
Each stage presents opportunities for automation:
- **AI-assisted**: ScriptEnhancement, KeyframeGeneration
- **Fully automated**: TranscriptAlignment, FinalOutput formatting
- **Human-in-the-loop**: ScriptReview, PostProcessing

### Metrics & Analytics
Track performance at each stage:
- Time spent per stage
- Rework frequency
- Quality scores
- Bottleneck identification
- Resource utilization

### Workflow Variations
Consider specialized workflows for:
- **Short-form content** (TikTok, Reels): Condensed workflow
- **Long-form content** (YouTube essays): Extended script and editing phases
- **Live content**: Real-time production with limited post-processing
- **Repurposed content**: Entry at different workflow stages
