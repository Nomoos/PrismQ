# Reusable Report Snippets

This directory contains reusable markdown snippets that are common across all module reports.

## 📁 Available Snippets

### _section_separator.md
A horizontal rule used to separate major sections in reports.

**Usage:**
```markdown
<!-- Include: _section_separator.md -->
---
```

While markdown doesn't support true includes, this serves as a reference for the consistent separator pattern used throughout all reports.

## 💡 Purpose

These snippets ensure:
1. **Consistency** - All reports use the same formatting
2. **Maintainability** - Changes to common elements can be documented centrally
3. **Documentation** - New report authors know what patterns to use

## 🔧 How to Use

When creating or updating a report:
1. Reference these snippets as a guide for consistent formatting
2. Copy the exact pattern from the snippet files
3. This ensures all reports maintain the same visual structure

## 📝 Notes

- These are reference files, not programmatically included
- They document the standard patterns used across all reports
- Keep these in sync with actual report formatting
