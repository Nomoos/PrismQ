# MVP Workflow Overview

**PrismQ MVP - Iterative Title-Script Co-Improvement Workflow (26 Stages)**

## Overview

The MVP workflow implements a comprehensive **26-stage iterative co-improvement process** where title and script are refined together through multiple review and improvement stages. This ensures the highest quality content through systematic validation and cross-checking.

### Key Innovation

Title and script improvements are **co-dependent** - each is reviewed and refined based on the other, creating a continuous quality improvement cycle that ensures alignment and coherence.

### Workflow Philosophy

- **Progressive Refinement**: Multiple version iterations (v1, v2, v3, v4+)
- **Cross-Validation**: Title and script validated against each other
- **Quality Gates**: Explicit acceptance checks before progression
- **Comprehensive Reviews**: Local AI reviews covering 5 quality dimensions
- **Expert Polish**: GPT-4/GPT-5 based expert review and refinement

## Workflow Principles

### 1. Co-Dependent Improvement

- **Title reviewed by script**: Title is evaluated in context of script content
- **Script reviewed by title**: Script is evaluated in context of title promise
- **Cross-validation**: Each element validated against the other + original idea

### 2. Version Tracking

- **v1**: Initial drafts (from idea)
- **v2**: First improvement cycle (using initial reviews)
- **v3**: Second refinement cycle (using v2 reviews)
- **v4+**: Additional cycles if acceptance checks fail

**Important**: When loops occur, **always use the newest/latest version** of both title and script.

### 3. Explicit Acceptance Gates

- **Title acceptance check** (stage 12): Must pass before checking script
- **Script acceptance check** (stage 13): Must pass before quality reviews
- **Quality validation** (stages 14-20): Final quality gates

### 4. Context Preservation

- Original versions preserved throughout
- Reviews reference originals for context
- Improvements build on previous versions
