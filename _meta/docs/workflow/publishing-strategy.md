# Progressive Multi-Format Publishing Strategy

### Sequential Format Enrichment

The workflow follows a **progressive enrichment model** where each format builds on the previous:

**1. Text → 2. Audio → 3. Video**

**Stage 1: Text Publication (Foundation)**
```
ScriptApproved → TextPublishing → PublishedText
  ├─→ AnalyticsReviewText (optional early analytics)
  ├─→ Voiceover (continue to audio production)
  └─→ Archived (text-only release)
```
- **Timeline**: Hours to days
- **Use Case**: Immediate publication, SEO content, blog posts
- **Published text serves as source for voiceover recording**

**Stage 2: Audio Publication (Enrichment)**
```
PublishedText → Voiceover → VoiceoverReview → VoiceoverApproved → 
AudioPublishing → PublishedAudio
  ├─→ AnalyticsReviewAudio (optional early analytics)
  ├─→ ScenePlanning (continue to video production)
  └─→ Archived (audio-only release)
```
- **Timeline**: Days to week
- **Use Case**: Podcast distribution, audio storytelling
- **Published audio serves as foundation for video scenes**

**Stage 3: Video Publication (Full Experience)**
```
PublishedAudio → ScenePlanning → KeyframePlanning → 
KeyframeGeneration → VideoAssembly → VideoReview → VideoFinalized → 
PublishPlanning → PublishedVideo → AnalyticsReviewVideo
```
- **Timeline**: Weeks
- **Use Case**: YouTube, TikTok, maximum engagement
- **Video combines published audio with visual elements**

### Content Flow Benefits

- **Progressive Release**: Publish text immediately, audio days later, video weeks later
- **Quality Builds**: Each format uses the refined previous format as source
- **Platform Optimization**: Each format optimized for its specific platforms
- **Audience Reach**: Cover all consumption preferences sequentially
- **Early Feedback**: Text analytics inform audio production, audio analytics inform video
- **SEO Layering**: Multiple publication dates and formats boost discoverability
- **Reduced Waste**: Stop at any stage (text-only, audio-only, or full video)
