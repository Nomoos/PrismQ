## Worker Issues (Background Task Execution)

### 🔴 Not Started

#### [ISSUE-WORKER-001](backlog/worker/ISSUE-WORKER-001-implement-cleanup-worker.md): Implement Cleanup Task Worker
**Component**: Worker/Workers (Not Client)  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Status**: Not Started - Belongs in Worker Project  
**Summary**: Create worker component to execute cleanup operations (old runs, temp files) when triggered by Client API via task queue.

**Key Features**:
- Cleanup old runs based on age threshold
- Cleanup temporary files
- Error handling with retry logic
- Configurable thresholds

**Dependencies**: None (independent worker)

#### [ISSUE-WORKER-002](backlog/worker/ISSUE-WORKER-002-implement-health-check-worker.md): Implement Health Check Worker
**Component**: Worker/Workers (Not Client)  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Status**: Not Started - Belongs in Worker Project  
**Summary**: Create worker component to perform comprehensive system health checks (CPU, memory, disk) when requested by Client API.

**Key Features**:
- Collect system metrics (CPU, memory, disk, tasks)
- Evaluate health status against thresholds
- Return comprehensive health report
- Configurable warning/error thresholds

**Dependencies**: None (independent worker)

## Integration Issues (Client ↔ Worker)

### 🔴 Not Started

#### [ISSUE-INTEGRATION-001](wip/integration/ISSUE-INTEGRATION-001-connect-client-to-worker-queue.md): Connect Client API to Worker Task Queue
**Component**: Backend/src/api/, Worker Integration  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: Not Started - Future Work  
**Summary**: Integrate Client's on-demand maintenance endpoints with worker task queue for async execution, better scalability, and separation of concerns.

**Scope**:
- Update API endpoints to enqueue tasks instead of executing directly
- Add task status endpoints for tracking
- Configure queue integration
- Update documentation

**Dependencies**:
- ISSUE-CLIENT-002 (✅ Complete)
- ISSUE-WORKER-001 (🔴 Not Started)
- ISSUE-WORKER-002 (🔴 Not Started)

## Parallelization Plan

### Phase 1: Client-Only Work ✅ COMPLETE
**Timeline**: Completed  
**Status**: All issues complete

**Track A - Backend Changes** (Sequential):
1. ✅ ISSUE-CLIENT-001: Remove periodic tasks
2. ✅ ISSUE-CLIENT-002: Add on-demand endpoints

**Track B - Documentation** (Parallel with Track A):
1. ✅ ISSUE-CLIENT-003: Create documentation

**Track C - Testing** (After Track A):
1. ✅ ISSUE-CLIENT-004: Add test suite

### Phase 2: Worker Development 🔴 NOT STARTED
**Timeline**: Future  
**Status**: Can be parallelized (independent workers)

**Track A - Cleanup Worker** (Independent):
1. 🔴 ISSUE-WORKER-001: Implement cleanup worker

**Track B - Health Check Worker** (Independent):
1. 🔴 ISSUE-WORKER-002: Implement health check worker

**Parallelization**: These workers are independent and can be developed simultaneously by different developers.

### Phase 3: Integration 🔴 NOT STARTED
**Timeline**: After Phase 2  
**Status**: Sequential work

**Sequential Work**:
1. 🔴 ISSUE-INTEGRATION-001: Connect Client API to worker task queue
   - Requires ISSUE-WORKER-001 and ISSUE-WORKER-002 to be complete

## Recommendations

### 1. Worker Architecture Decision
**Decision Needed**: Determine if workers should be:
- **Option A**: Same repository, separate directory (`PrismQ.Client/Workers/`)
- **Option B**: Separate repository (`PrismQ.Workers/`)

**Recommendation**: Start with Option A for easier development, migrate to Option B when workers mature.

### 2. Priority Order for Next Steps
1. **Decision**: Choose worker architecture (same repo vs separate)
2. **High Priority**: ISSUE-WORKER-001 (Cleanup worker) - Most frequently needed
3. **High Priority**: ISSUE-INTEGRATION-001 (Task queue integration) - Enables async execution
4. **Medium Priority**: ISSUE-WORKER-002 (Health check worker) - Useful for monitoring

### 3. Existing Infrastructure
The project already has queue infrastructure at `Backend/src/queue/`:
- Database-backed queue (`database.py`)
- Worker support (`worker.py`)
- Task handler registry (`task_handler_registry.py`)
- Scheduling strategies (`scheduling.py`)

**Recommendation**: Review and use existing queue infrastructure instead of creating new.

### 4. Gradual Migration
For ISSUE-INTEGRATION-001, use gradual migration:
1. Keep direct execution endpoints as default
2. Add async endpoints with `/async` suffix
3. Test async endpoints
4. Switch UI to async endpoints
5. Remove direct execution endpoints

This ensures backward compatibility and safer deployment.
