# ScriptDraft

**Workflow Stage: Script Development Phase - Initial Draft**

## Overview

The **ScriptDraft** stage represents the initial scriptwriting phase where the outline and skeleton are expanded into a complete first draft.

## Position in Workflow

```
Script → [ScriptDraft] → ScriptReview → ScriptApproved → Voiceover
```

## Purpose

Create the first complete version of the script, transforming the outline and skeleton into full narrative text. This stage focuses on:

- Getting ideas on paper
- Expanding all sections
- Establishing voice and tone
- Creating complete dialogue/narration
- Setting initial pacing

## Key Activities

1. **Expand Outline** - Transform outline points into full paragraphs
2. **Write Dialogue** - Create natural conversational text
3. **Develop Narration** - Write narrative descriptions and transitions
4. **Set Initial Timing** - Estimate section durations
5. **Establish Voice** - Define consistent narrative voice

## Draft Characteristics

### First Draft Focus
- ✅ Completeness over perfection
- ✅ Get all ideas written
- ✅ Follow the skeleton structure
- ✅ Maintain consistent voice
- ✅ Hit target length approximately

### Not Expected in First Draft
- ❌ Perfect grammar and polish
- ❌ Optimized pacing
- ❌ Refined emotional beats
- ❌ Performance-ready formatting

## Deliverables

- Complete first draft script
- Initial timing estimates
- Section markers
- Draft metadata (word count, estimated duration)

## Quality Checkpoints

Before moving to ScriptReview, verify:
- [ ] All outline sections are expanded
- [ ] Script follows skeleton structure
- [ ] Target length is approximately met
- [ ] Tone is consistent throughout
- [ ] No major gaps or missing sections
- [ ] Basic readability is acceptable

## Transition Criteria

A script moves from Draft stage when:
- ✅ Complete first draft exists
- ✅ All sections from outline are included
- ✅ Target length is within 20% of goal
- ✅ Initial self-review is complete
- ✅ Ready for editorial review
