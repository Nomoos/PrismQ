# Script

**Workflow Stage: Script Development Phase**

## Overview

The **Script** module manages the entire scriptwriting phase of content production. It coordinates the process from initial draft through review to final approval.

## Position in Workflow

```
Title → [Script] → ScriptDraft → ScriptReview → ScriptApproved → Voiceover
```

## Purpose

Produce the full narrative in natural spoken form. The script transforms the outline and skeleton into complete, ready-to-perform content that:

- Uses natural speech patterns
- Includes dialogue and narration
- Maintains consistent tone
- Follows the established structure
- Is optimized for audio/video delivery

## Sub-Stages

This module contains three sub-stages:

1. **[ScriptDraft](./ScriptDraft/)** - Initial script writing
2. **[ScriptReview](./ScriptReview/)** - Quality review and enhancement
3. **[ScriptApproved](./ScriptApproved/)** - Final approved scripts ready for production

## Key Activities

1. **Write Full Script** - Create complete narrative text
2. **Natural Speech** - Ensure conversational, speakable language
3. **Include Beats** - Incorporate narrative and emotional beats
4. **Add Transitions** - Create smooth scene and topic transitions
5. **Format for Performance** - Structure for easy reading/performance

## Workflow Progression

```
Script State → ScriptDraft → ScriptReview → ScriptApproved
                    ↓              ↓              ↓
