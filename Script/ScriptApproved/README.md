## Overview

The **ScriptApproved** stage contains scripts that have completed the review process and are approved for voiceover production.

## Position in Workflow

- ✅ Pacing optimized
- ✅ Technical quality verified
- ✅ Stakeholder approval received
- ✅ Locked for production

### Production Readiness
- Performance-ready formatting
- Clear voice direction notes

## Approval Process

1. **Final Review** - Last quality check
2. **Stakeholder Sign-Off** - Required approvals obtained

5. **Archive Original** - Preserve approved version

## Version Control

### Approved Script Management
- Approved scripts are locked (read-only)
- Changes require new review cycle
- Version history preserved
- Original approval metadata maintained

### Post-Approval Changes
If changes are needed after approval:
1. Create new version
2. Document reason for change
3. Return to ScriptReview
4. Re-approval required

## Deliverables

- Final approved script (locked)
- Production specifications
- Voice direction notes
