# ScenePlanning

**Workflow Stage: Visual Production Phase - Scene Design**

## Overview

The **ScenePlanning** stage represents the phase where visual tone, pacing, and scene structure are designed to complement the voiceover audio.

## Position in Workflow

```
VoiceoverApproved → [ScenePlanning] → KeyframePlanning → KeyframeGeneration
```

## Purpose

Decide visual tone, pacing, and scene structure that will bring the script to life. This stage establishes:

- Visual aesthetic and style
- Scene composition approach
- Pacing and timing alignment
- Transition strategies
- Overall visual narrative

## Key Activities

1. **Define Visual Style** - Establish aesthetic guidelines
2. **Plan Scene Structure** - Design scene breakdown and flow
3. **Design Composition** - Plan visual layouts and framing
4. **Establish Pacing** - Align visual tempo with audio
5. **Plan Transitions** - Design scene-to-scene flow

## Scene Planning Elements

### Visual Style Guide
- Color palette
- Artistic style (realistic, illustrated, abstract, etc.)
- Mood and atmosphere
- Lighting approach
- Visual references

### Scene Breakdown
- Scene list with descriptions
- Duration for each scene
- Visual focus points
- Key visual elements
- Audio-visual alignment

### Composition Guidelines
- Framing rules
- Visual hierarchy
- Text placement
- Logo and branding
- Safe zones for different platforms

### Pacing Strategy
- Scene length distribution
- Cut timing relative to audio
- Energy level mapping
- Visual rhythm patterns

## Planning Process

1. **Audio Analysis** - Review approved voiceover for visual cues
2. **Reference Gathering** - Collect visual inspiration
3. **Style Definition** - Create visual style guide
4. **Scene Mapping** - Break down content into scenes
5. **Timing Alignment** - Sync scene planning with audio timing

## Scene Types

### Static Scenes
- Single image with text/effects
- Duration: 3-8 seconds typical
- Use for: Titles, quotes, simple concepts

### Dynamic Scenes
- Multiple elements, transitions
- Duration: 5-15 seconds typical
- Use for: Complex ideas, storytelling

### B-Roll Scenes
- Supporting visual footage
- Duration: 2-5 seconds typical
- Use for: Examples, context, variety

### Transition Scenes
- Bridge between major sections
- Duration: 1-3 seconds typical
- Use for: Flow, pacing, chapter breaks

## Deliverables

- Visual style guide document
- Scene breakdown spreadsheet/document
- Composition sketches or mockups
- Pacing timeline
- Transition plan
- Reference imagery collection

## Scene Planning Template

```
Scene #: [Number]
Duration: [Start Time] - [End Time] (Total: XX seconds)
Audio Reference: [Key audio content]
Visual Focus: [Main visual element]
Composition: [Layout description]
Style Notes: [Specific visual directions]
Assets Needed: [List of required elements]
Transition: [How scene enters/exits]
```

## Quality Checkpoints

Before moving to KeyframePlanning:
- [ ] Visual style is clearly defined
- [ ] All scenes are planned and timed
- [ ] Pacing aligns with audio
- [ ] Compositions are sketched
- [ ] Transitions are specified
- [ ] Asset requirements identified
- [ ] Style consistency verified

## Transition Criteria

Planning moves to KeyframePlanning when:
- ✅ Complete scene breakdown exists
- ✅ Visual style guide is finalized
- ✅ All scenes timed to audio
- ✅ Composition approach defined
- ✅ Asset list is complete
- ✅ Stakeholder approval received

## Platform Considerations

### YouTube (16:9)
- Horizontal format
- Readable text at all sizes
- Thumbnail-optimized opening
- Engaging visual variety

### TikTok/Reels (9:16)
- Vertical format
- Bold, eye-catching visuals
- Fast-paced cuts
- Text-heavy for sound-off viewing

### Instagram (1:1)
- Square format
- Mobile-optimized sizing
- Clear focal points
- Consistent branding
