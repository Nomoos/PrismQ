Final Principle: Video = Keyframes + Scene Descriptions + Subtitles

1️⃣ VISUAL LAYER (Keyframes)

These are your core images, defining the look, mood, and style.

Sources include:

AI keyframes (from text scenes or enhanced keyframes)

Style-consistent set from FromKeyframesAndTextScenes

Variants and refined versions

Keyframes determine:

the visual atmosphere

shot transitions

cinematic pacing

emotional tone

This is the base visual foundation.

2️⃣ STRUCTURAL LAYER (Scene Descriptions)

These scenes define:

when keyframes appear

which visuals pair with which narration

camera movements

transitions between shots

reinforcement of emotional arc

This layer is created in V/Scene/FromSubtitles and improved in V/Keyframe.

Scenes become your timeline skeleton:

Scene start → keyframe
Scene continues → animation, zooms, pan
Scene ends → new keyframe or visual change

3️⃣ TIMING LAYER (Subtitles — Word-Level)

This is the final and most precise layer, applied after the video is almost complete.

Word-level subtitles determine:

exact timestamp alignment

fast cut sync

beat matching

micro transitions

“breathing space” pacing

dramatic pauses visualized

Why subtitles LAST?

Because:

✔ Your visuals depend on scenes
✔ Scenes depend on audio rhythm
✔ Audio rhythm is finalized before subtitles
✔ Subtitles reveal exact micro-beats of the performance
