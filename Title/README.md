# Title

**Workflow Stage: Idea Development Phase**

## Overview

The **Title** stage represents the phase where the content is given its final title and metadata. This critical stage defines how the content will be presented and discovered.

## Position in Workflow

```
IdeaInspiration → Idea → Outline → Skeleton → [Title] → Script
```

## Purpose

Develop compelling titles and metadata that capture attention and accurately represent the content. This stage creates:

- Main title (headline)
- Subtitle (if applicable)
- Social media variations
- SEO-optimized versions
- Platform-specific adaptations

## Key Activities

1. **Create Main Title** - Develop the primary content title
2. **Test Variations** - Generate and evaluate multiple title options
3. **Optimize for SEO** - Ensure discoverability through search
4. **Adapt for Platforms** - Create platform-specific title versions
5. **Validate Appeal** - Test emotional impact and click-worthiness

## Title Best Practices

### For YouTube
- Keep under 60 characters (ideal: 40-50)
- Include target keywords early
- Create curiosity or value proposition
- Use numbers, questions, or emotional triggers

### For TikTok
- Short and punchy (under 40 characters)
- Use trending terminology
- Include relevant hashtags in description

### For Podcasts

## Deliverables
