# Outline

**Workflow Stage: Idea Development Phase**

## Overview

The **Outline** stage represents the phase where an Idea is expanded into a structured content outline. This stage transforms the core concept into a detailed framework that guides the content creation process.

## Position in Workflow

```
IdeaInspiration → Idea → [Outline] → Skeleton → Title → Script
```

## Purpose

Create a structured outline that organizes the Idea's key points, flow, and narrative arc into a logical sequence. The outline serves as a roadmap for the content, defining:

- Main sections and subsections
- Key message points
- Content flow and progression
- Supporting arguments or evidence
- Transitional elements

## Key Activities

1. **Expand Core Concept** - Develop the Idea's concept into detailed sections
2. **Structure Content** - Organize information in a logical, engaging sequence
3. **Define Sections** - Create clear divisions for different content segments
4. **Plan Narrative Arc** - Establish the story progression or argument flow
5. **Identify Key Points** - List essential messages and takeaways

## Deliverables

- Detailed content outline with sections and subsections
- Key message framework
- Content flow map
- Section descriptions

## Transition Criteria

An Idea moves from Outline stage when:
- ✅ All major sections are identified and ordered
- ✅ Key message points are documented
- ✅ Content flow is logical and engaging
- ✅ Outline is detailed enough to guide script creation
