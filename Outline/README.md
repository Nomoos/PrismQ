# Outline (Osnova)

**Workflow Stage: Idea Development Phase**

## Overview

The **Outline** stage represents the phase where an Idea is expanded into a structured content outline. This stage transforms the core concept into a detailed framework that guides the content creation process.

The Outline is the **"construction plan" (plán stavby)** that helps maintain direction throughout production.

## Position in Workflow

```
IdeaInspiration → Idea → [Outline] → Skeleton → Title → Script
```

## Purpose

Create a **detailed map of the entire story** (detailní mapa celého příběhu) that organizes the Idea's key points, flow, and narrative arc into a logical sequence. 

The outline serves as a roadmap for the content, containing:

- **Main plot points** (hlavní body děje)
- **Character development progression** (postup vývoje postav)
- **Key twists** (klíčové zvraty)
- **Chapter structure** (strukturu kapitol)
- Supporting arguments or evidence
- Transitional elements

The Outline is the "construction plan" – it helps maintain direction and ensures all essential story elements are properly positioned.

## Key Activities

1. **Map Main Plot Points** - Identify and sequence key story events (hlavní body děje)
2. **Plan Character Development** - Chart character growth and progression (postup vývoje postav)
3. **Position Key Twists** - Place major revelations and turning points (klíčové zvraty)
4. **Structure Chapters** - Define chapter/section boundaries (strukturu kapitol)
5. **Define Narrative Arc** - Establish the story progression or argument flow
6. **Identify Transitions** - Plan smooth connections between sections

## Deliverables

- **Detailed content outline** with sections and subsections
- **Plot point map** - Visual or textual mapping of main story events
- **Character development arc** - How characters evolve through the story
- **Key twist placement** - Strategic positioning of revelations
- **Chapter structure** - Clear section/chapter boundaries
- **Content flow map** - Visual representation of narrative progression
- **Section descriptions** - Brief summary of each major section

## Outline Structure Example

### For Narrative Content
```
Chapter 1: Opening Hook
- Introduce protagonist and world
- Establish the ordinary world
- Hint at conflict to come
[Character: Protagonist begins unaware]

Chapter 2: Inciting Incident  
- Key twist: Discovery that changes everything
- Protagonist forced to take action
[Character: Realization and decision point]

Chapter 3: Rising Action
- Obstacles and challenges
- Character development through trials
- Secondary characters introduced
[Character: Growth through adversity]

Chapter 4: Midpoint Twist
- Major revelation shifts perspective
- Stakes raised significantly
[Character: Fundamental change in understanding]

Chapter 5: Complications
- Plans go wrong
- Darkest moment approaches
[Character: Testing of resolve]

Chapter 6: Climax
- Final confrontation
- All plot threads converge
[Character: Ultimate choice and action]

Chapter 7: Resolution
- Consequences play out
- New equilibrium established
[Character: Transformed by journey]
```

### For Educational/Informational Content
```
Section 1: Introduction & Hook (0:00-1:00)
- Why this topic matters
- What viewers will learn
- Compelling opening question

Section 2: Background Context (1:00-3:00)
- Historical or foundational information
- Setting up the core concept
- Key terms and definitions

Section 3: Main Concept Explanation (3:00-6:00)
- Deep dive into the subject
- Examples and demonstrations
- Visual aids and metaphors

Section 4: Practical Application (6:00-8:00)
- How to use this information
- Real-world examples
- Step-by-step guidance

Section 5: Advanced Insights (8:00-9:30)
- Deeper implications
- Common misconceptions
- Expert-level considerations

Section 6: Conclusion & Call to Action (9:30-10:00)
- Summary of key points
- Next steps for viewers
- Resources and links
```

## Transition Criteria

An Idea moves from Outline stage when:
- ✅ All major sections are identified and ordered
- ✅ Key message points are documented
- ✅ Content flow is logical and engaging
- ✅ Outline is detailed enough to guide script creation
