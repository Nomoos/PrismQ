# Issues

Module-specific issue tracking.

## Structure

- `new/` - Newly identified issues
- `wip/` - Issues currently being worked on
- `done/` - Completed issues

## Files

- `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` - List of known issues
- `ROADMAP.md` - Development roadmap

## Workflow

1. Create issue file in `new/`
2. Move to `wip/` when work starts
3. Move to `done/` when completed
4. Update KNOWN_ISSUES.md and ROADMAP.md as needed
