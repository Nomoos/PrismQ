## 🎨 Work Distribution by Skill

### Backend Focus

| Week | Issues | Parallel? | Estimated Total |
|------|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1-2 | #104, #106 | ✅ YES | 2-3 weeks (if parallel: 2 weeks) |
| 3-4 | Support #108 | ⚠️ Partial | 1 week |
| 5-6 | #109 | ✅ YES | 1 week |
| 7-8 | #110 (part), #111 (part) | ✅ YES | 2 weeks |

**Total Backend**: 5-7 weeks (can reduce to 4-5 with parallelization)

---

### Frontend Focus

| Week | Issues | Parallel? | Estimated Total |
|------|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1-4 | #105 | ✅ YES | 2-3 weeks |
| 5-6 | #107 | ⚠️ Depends on #104 | 2 weeks |
| 7-8 | #110 (part), #112 | ✅ YES | 2 weeks |

**Total Frontend**: 6-7 weeks (can't reduce much due to #107 dependency on #104)

---

### Source Integration Focus

| Week | Issues | Parallel? | Estimated Total |
|------|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1-8 | All 12 remaining Signals sources | ✅ YES | 3-5 days per source |
| | **Option A**: 1 dev, 12 sources | No | 8-12 weeks |
| | **Option B**: 4 devs, 3 sources each | ✅ YES | 2-3 weeks |
| | **Option C**: 12 devs, 1 source each | ✅ YES | 3-5 days |

**Recommendation**: 2-4 developers for optimal balance

## 🚦 Critical Path Analysis

### Without Parallelization (Sequential)
```
#101 → #102 → #103 → #104 → #105 → #106 → #107 → #108 → #109 → #110 → #111 → #112
  ✅     ✅     ✅      🔜      🔜      🔜      🔜      🔜      🔜      🔜      🔜      🔜

Total Time: 18-22 weeks
```

### With Full Parallelization (Optimal)
```
Week 1-2:  #104 + #105 + #106 (parallel)
Week 3-4:  #107 + #108 (parallel, depends on #104)
Week 5-6:  #109 (independent)
Week 7-8:  #110 → #111 + #112 (parallel)

Total Time: 7-8 weeks (61% time reduction!)
```

## 🎯 Team Size Recommendations

### 2-3 Developers (Minimum Viable)
- **Timeline**: 10-12 weeks
- **Approach**: Mostly sequential with some parallelization
- **Risk**: Medium - limited capacity for blockers

### 4-6 Developers (Recommended)
- **Timeline**: 7-8 weeks  
- **Approach**: Maximum parallelization
- **Risk**: Low - good capacity for blockers

### 7+ Developers (Accelerated)
- **Timeline**: 7-8 weeks (same as 4-6)
- **Approach**: Source implementations can scale up
- **Risk**: Very Low - high redundancy
- **Note**: Diminishing returns after 6 devs on Client work

---

## 📈 ROI of Parallelization

| Metric | Sequential | Parallel (4 devs) | Savings |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| **Timeline** | 18-22 weeks | 7-8 weeks | **61% faster** |
| **Developer weeks** | 18-22 dev-weeks | 28-32 dev-weeks | +42% effort |
| **Time to market** | 5.5 months | 2 months | **3.5 months earlier** |
| **Blockers impact** | High (blocks all) | Low (isolated) | **Lower risk** |

**Verdict**: Parallelization with 4-6 developers is optimal

## ✅ Quick Decision Matrix

### Starting Today (Week 1)

**Q: How many developers do you have?**

- **1 developer**: Start #104, then #106, then #105 (10-12 weeks total)
- **2 developers**: Dev #1: #104+#107, Dev #2: #105+#106 (8-10 weeks)
- **3 developers**: Dev #1: #104, Dev #2: #105, Dev #3: #106+#108 (7-9 weeks)
- **4+ developers**: Dev #1: #104, Dev #2: #105, Dev #3: #106, Dev #4+: Sources (7-8 weeks)

**Q: What if I have backend/frontend specialists?**

- **Backend heavy team**: Prioritize #104, #106, #108, #109 first
- **Frontend heavy team**: Prioritize #105, #107, #112 first
- **Balanced team**: Follow the week-by-week plan above

**Q: What's the minimum to launch?**

Critical path: #104 → #105 → #107 → #110 (5-6 weeks minimum)
Can skip: #106, #108, #109, #111, #112 initially (add later)

---

## 🎓 Key Takeaways

1. **Maximum parallelization**: 4 independent streams in Week 1-2
2. **Optimal team size**: 4-6 developers
3. **Critical bottleneck**: #104 must complete before #107 can start
4. **Best ROI**: 61% time reduction with proper parallelization
5. **Signals Sources**: Can run indefinitely in parallel (no limit on developers)
6. **Risk mitigation**: Parallel work reduces impact of individual blockers

## 📞 Need Help Choosing?

### Conservative Approach (Low Risk)
- Start with #104, #105, #106 in parallel
- Wait until all complete before #107, #108
- Sequential from there
- **Timeline**: 9-10 weeks

### Balanced Approach (Recommended)
- Full parallelization per the week-by-week plan
- Start #107 as soon as #104 completes
- **Timeline**: 7-8 weeks

### Aggressive Approach (High Velocity)
- 6+ developers
- All parallel streams + Sources
- Continuous integration testing
- **Timeline**: 7-8 weeks (same endpoint, but more buffer)
