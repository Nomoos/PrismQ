# Phase 1: Foundation & Integration

**Priority**: High  
**Duration**: 8-10 weeks  
**Timeline**: Q2 2025

## Overview

Establish robust infrastructure for data persistence, pipeline orchestration, and API access.

## Objectives

- Implement unified pipeline integration
- Set up database infrastructure
- Create RESTful API endpoints
- Enable seamless data flow between modules
- Establish error recovery mechanisms

## Issues

- **#001** - Unified Pipeline Integration (4-6 weeks)
  - Seamless data flow between modules
  - Batch processing capabilities
  - Error recovery and retry logic
  - Progress tracking and logging

- **#002** - Database Integration (3-4 weeks)
  - Repository pattern implementation
  - Query optimization and indexing
  - Migration system (Alembic)
  - Support for 100K+ records

- **#005** - RESTful API Endpoints (3-4 weeks)
  - Complete CRUD operations
  - Pipeline operation endpoints
  - OpenAPI documentation
  - Authentication and rate limiting

## Success Criteria

- [ ] End-to-end pipeline processing working
- [ ] Database storing all IdeaInspiration data
- [ ] API endpoints functional and documented
- [ ] >80% test coverage for new components
