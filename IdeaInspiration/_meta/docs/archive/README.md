### Running Archived Scripts

The Python scripts in this archive have been updated to work from their archived location. They use relative path calculations to find the repository root and modules.

**Note**: These scripts are kept for historical reference. If you need to run similar validations or demonstrations, consider creating new scripts in the appropriate location rather than using these archived versions.

To run an archived script:
```bash
# From repository root
python3 _meta/docs/archive/validation/demo_batch_processing.py
```
