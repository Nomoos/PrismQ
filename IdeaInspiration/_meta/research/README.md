# Research

This directory contains research materials, experiments, and exploratory work for the PrismQ.IdeaInspiration project.

## Purpose

Store research-related content including:
- Experimental code and prototypes
- Research papers and references
- Performance benchmarks and analysis
- Model comparisons and evaluations
- Algorithm explorations

## Structure

Organize research by topic or experiment:
- Create subdirectories for major research areas
- Use descriptive names for research files and folders
- Include README files to explain the research context
- Document findings and conclusions

## Best Practices

- Keep research separate from production code
- Document methodology and findings
- Include reproduction steps for experiments
- Note hardware specifications for benchmarks (especially RTX 5090 results)
- Link to related issues or features when applicable

## Note

Research materials here may eventually be incorporated into the main codebase or published as separate documentation.
