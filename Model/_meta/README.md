# Module Metadata

This `_meta` directory contains metadata, documentation, examples, tests, and issue tracking for the Model module.

## Structure

- **docs/** - Module documentation and guides
- **examples/** - Usage examples and sample code
- **tests/** - Module tests and test data
- **research/** - Research documents and analysis
- **issues/** - Issue tracking organized by state
  - **new/** - Newly created issues
  - **blocked/** - Issues that are blocked
  - **wip/** - Work in progress issues
  - **done/** - Completed issues

## Purpose

The `_meta` directory keeps module-related metadata organized and separate from the main module content, providing a standardized location for documentation, examples, testing artifacts, and issue management.

## Usage

- Add documentation to `docs/` as the module develops
- Place working examples in `examples/`
- Store test files in `tests/`
- Keep research and analysis in `research/`
- Track issues in `issues/` using the state subfolders
