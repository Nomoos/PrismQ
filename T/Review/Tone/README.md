Tone

Purpose:
Ensure the emotional and narrative tone matches your target audience and style.

What goes here:

Adjustments to emotional intensity

Style alignment (dark, suspense, dramatic, etc.)

Voice and POV consistency

Audience-specific tone tuning (e.g., US female 14–29)

Balance of mystery/creepiness/drama

Removing tonal mismatches

Goal:
The script feels right, emotionally and stylistically.
