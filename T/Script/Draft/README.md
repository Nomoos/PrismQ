# Script Draft

**Module**: `PrismQ.T.Script.Draft`

## Purpose

This module contains the primary script draft—the first complete narrative realization of an Idea. Script drafts are generated after the Idea outline and working title are prepared, transforming structured concepts into natural, spoken-form content.

## What Goes Here

### Content Types
- **First Full Script Draft**: Complete narrative from hook to conclusion
- **Raw or AI-Generated Scripts**: Initial output before any review
- **Scene Structure**: For video/audio, the narrative and timing structure
- **Narration and Dialogue**: Complete text for voiceover or presentation
- **Early Versions**: Before any reviews or improvements
- **Initial Variations**: Alternative approaches that might feed refinement

### File Format
```markdown
{idea_id}_script_draft_v1.md

With metadata header:
---
idea_id: [reference]
title: [working title]
version: 1.0
status: SCRIPT_DRAFT
created: YYYY-MM-DD
target_platform: [Blog/Podcast/Video/Multi]
target_length: [word count]
---
```

## When Used

**Workflow Position:**
```
Idea (Outline → Skeleton → Title) → Script Draft → Script Review
                                          ↑
                                     YOU ARE HERE
```

**Timing:**
- After Idea is in `IDEA_TITLE` status
- Before entering Script Review (T/Rewiew modules)
- Before Script Improvements or Optimization

## Key Characteristics

### Complete but Imperfect
- Full narrative exists (no major gaps)
- Hook, context, main content, conclusion, CTA present
- Natural, conversational voice
- Readable aloud without major stumbling
- NOT yet refined, edited, or optimized

### Focus: Completion Over Perfection
Script drafts prioritize getting the complete narrative down. Refinement happens in later stages:
- **Script Review**: Multi-dimensional quality check
- **Script Improvements**: Address review feedback
- **Script Optimization**: Final polish for maximum impact

- [ ] Complete narrative from hook to conclusion
- [ ] All outline sections addressed

### Can Wait (handled in later stages)

- Maximum engagement tactics
- Platform-specific optimization
- SEO integration
