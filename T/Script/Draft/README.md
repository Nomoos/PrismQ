Draft

Purpose:
This folder holds the primary script draft, generated after the Outline and early TitleDraft are prepared.

What goes here:

First full script draft (raw or AI-generated)

Scene structure, narration, dialogue

Early versions before any reviews

Script created directly from Idea → Outline → TitleDraft

Any initial variations that might feed refinement

When used:
Before entering ContentReview or Editing.
