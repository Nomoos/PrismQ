Optimization

Purpose:
Light improvements and adjustments to the finished script for readability, timing, and flow, after all major reviews are finished.

What goes here:

Small tweaks to pacing or timing

Adjusted phrasing for smoother voiceover

Micro-improvements that don’t require full review loops

Final voice-flow adjustments before ReadabilityReview

Minor post-Review enhancements (but not heavy rewrites)

When used:
Usually after ToneCheck and before final ReadabilityReview, or right after ReadabilityReview if only tiny refinements are needed.

This stage is not rewriting — it's polishing.
