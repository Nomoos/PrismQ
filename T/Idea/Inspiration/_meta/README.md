# _meta

This directory contains project-level metadata, documentation, and organizational materials for the PrismQ.IdeaInspiration repository.

## Structure

- **docs/** - Project-level documentation (architecture, contributing, development guides)
- **issues/** - Issue tracking and project management (new, wip, done)
- **research/** - Research materials, experiments, and exploratory work

## Purpose

The `_meta` folder serves as a centralized location for project metadata that doesn't belong in the main source code directories. This keeps the repository root clean while providing a clear location for:

- Project-wide documentation
- Issue tracking workflow
- Research and experimental work
- Planning and roadmap materials

## Note

Individual modules (Classification, Scoring, Sources, etc.) may have their own `docs/`, `issues/`, or similar folders for module-specific content. This `_meta` directory is specifically for repository-level materials.
