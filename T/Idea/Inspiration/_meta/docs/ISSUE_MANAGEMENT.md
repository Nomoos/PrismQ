# Issue Management Guide

**Purpose**: Guide for managing issues across the PrismQ.T.Idea.Inspiration repository  
**Last Updated**: 2025-11-13  
**Version**: 1.0

---

## 📋 Overview

This repository uses a structured issue management system with two parallel tracks:
1. **Repository-level issues** (`_meta/issues/`) - Infrastructure, coordination, cross-cutting concerns
2. **Source module issues** (`Source/_meta/issues/`) - Module-specific implementations

## 📝 Issue Workflow

### Standard Workflow States

Issues progress through the following states:

```
new → ready → wip → review → done
  ↓                    ↓
blocked ←──────────────┘
  ↓
ready (when unblocked)
```

**State Definitions**:
- **new**: Issues awaiting triage, clarification, or specification
- **ready**: Fully specified issues ready to implement now (all dependencies resolved)
- **wip**: Active development in progress
- **review**: Code complete, awaiting peer review
- **blocked**: Cannot proceed due to dependencies or missing information

### 6. Handling Blocked Issues (Any State → Blocked)

**When to move**:
- Missing required information or clarification
- Waiting on external dependency
- Blocked by another issue
- Technical blocker requiring investigation

**How to move**:
```bash
# From any state (new, ready, wip, review)
# Repository level
mv _meta/issues/[current-state]/001-issue.md _meta/issues/blocked/

# Module level
mv Source/_meta/issues/[current-state]/001-issue.md Source/_meta/issues/blocked/

**Unblocking (Blocked → Ready)**:

Once the blocker is resolved:
```bash
# Repository level
mv _meta/issues/blocked/001-issue.md _meta/issues/ready/

# Module level
mv Source/_meta/issues/blocked/001-issue.md Source/_meta/issues/ready/
```

**Update issue**:
- Change `**Status**: Blocked` to `**Status**: Ready`
- Add `**Unblocked Date**: YYYY-MM-DD`
- Add `**Resolution**: [How blocker was resolved]`
- Remove or update blocking reason

**Purpose**: The `blocked/` folder keeps the active workflow (ready/wip/review) clean and focused on actionable work. Team members can periodically review blocked issues to help resolve blockers.

### 7. Obsolete Issues

**When to obsolete**:
- Requirements changed
- Superseded by different approach
- No longer relevant

**How to handle**:
```bash
# Move to obsolete folder (Source module only)
mv Source/_meta/issues/new/Developer01/001-issue.md Source/_meta/issues/obsolete/Developer01/

# Repository level: Delete or move to done with "Obsolete" note
```

**Mark clearly**:
```markdown
**Status**: ⚠️ OBSOLETE - [Reason]
**Replaced By**: [New issue or approach]
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### For Issue Creators (Worker01, Developer01)

1. **Clear Objectives**: Define specific, measurable goals
2. **Acceptance Criteria**: Make them testable and specific
3. **Dependencies**: Document all blocking issues
4. **Right Size**: Issues should be 1-5 days of work
5. **SOLID Review**: Ensure Worker10/Developer10 reviews architecture

### For Implementers (Worker02-09, Developer02-09)

1. **Read Thoroughly**: Understand requirements before starting
2. **Update Status**: Keep issue file current with progress
3. **Ask Questions**: Comment in issue if unclear
4. **Test First**: Write tests alongside implementation
5. **Document**: Update docs as you implement

### For Reviewers (Worker10, Developer10)

1. **Architecture First**: Review design before deep dive
2. **SOLID Principles**: Validate adherence
3. **Constructive**: Provide specific, actionable feedback
4. **Timely**: Review within 1-2 days
5. **Approve Explicitly**: Mark issue as reviewed

## 📈 Metrics & Reporting

### Issue Velocity

Track completion rate:
```bash
# Count issues by status
echo "New (awaiting triage): $(find _meta/issues/new -name "*.md" -type f | wc -l)"
echo "Ready (can implement now): $(ls _meta/issues/ready/*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l)"
echo "WIP (in progress): $(ls _meta/issues/wip/*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l)"
echo "Review (awaiting review): $(ls _meta/issues/review/*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l)"
echo "Blocked: $(ls _meta/issues/blocked/*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l)"
echo "Done: $(find _meta/issues/done -name "*.md" -type f | wc -l)"
```

### Team Performance

Monitor per worker/developer:
```bash
# Worker01 completion
ls _meta/issues/done/Worker01/*.md | wc -l

# Developer02 completion
ls Source/_meta/issues/done/Developer02/*.md | wc -l
```

### Time Tracking

Include in issue completion:
```markdown
**Estimated**: 3 days
**Actual**: 4 days
**Variance**: +1 day
```

## 🔧 Issue Management Tools

### Quick Commands

Add to your shell profile:
```bash
# Move issue to ready (after triage)
issue_ready() {
    mv "_meta/issues/new/$1" "_meta/issues/ready/"
}

# Move issue to WIP (start work)
issue_wip() {
    mv "_meta/issues/ready/$1" "_meta/issues/wip/"
}

# Move issue to review
issue_review() {
    mv "_meta/issues/wip/$1" "_meta/issues/review/"
}

# Move issue to done
issue_done() {
    WORKER=$(echo $1 | cut -d'-' -f1)
    mkdir -p "_meta/issues/done/${WORKER}"
    mv "_meta/issues/review/$1" "_meta/issues/done/${WORKER}/"
}

# Move issue to blocked
issue_block() {
    # Can be called from any state
    CURRENT_DIR=$(dirname $(find _meta/issues -name "$1" -type f | head -1))
    mv "${CURRENT_DIR}/$1" "_meta/issues/blocked/"
}

# Unblock issue (move to ready)
issue_unblock() {
    mv "_meta/issues/blocked/$1" "_meta/issues/ready/"
}

# Find issue by ID
issue_find() {
    find _meta/issues -name "$1*" -type f
}
```

### Status Report Script

Create `scripts/issue_status.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "=== Repository Issues ==="
echo "New (triage): $(find _meta/issues/new -name "*.md" -type f | wc -l)"
echo "Ready: $(ls _meta/issues/ready/*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l)"
echo "WIP: $(ls _meta/issues/wip/*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l)"
echo "Review: $(ls _meta/issues/review/*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l)"
echo "Blocked: $(ls _meta/issues/blocked/*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l)"
echo "Done: $(find _meta/issues/done -name "*.md" -type f | wc -l)"
echo ""
echo "=== Source Module Issues ==="
echo "New (triage): $(find Source/_meta/issues/new -name "*.md" -type f | wc -l)"
echo "Ready: $(ls Source/_meta/issues/ready/*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l)"
echo "WIP: $(ls Source/_meta/issues/wip/*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l)"
echo "Review: $(ls Source/_meta/issues/review/*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l)"
echo "Blocked: $(ls Source/_meta/issues/blocked/*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l)"

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: When should I use Worker vs Developer?
**A**: Workers handle repository-level infrastructure. Developers handle Source module implementations.

### Q: Can one person be both a Worker and Developer?
**A**: Yes! The roles are organizational. One person can work on both tracks.

### Q: What if an issue spans both tracks?
**A**: Create separate issues in each track and link them.

### Q: When should I move an issue to ready/?
**A**: When all requirements are clear, dependencies resolved, and it's ready for anyone to pick up and implement.

### Q: Can I skip the ready/ state?
**A**: Yes, for urgent issues you can go directly from new/ to wip/, but document why in the issue.

### Q: What's the difference between blocked/ and new/?
**A**: new/ is for unspecified issues; blocked/ is for fully specified issues that hit an impediment during execution.

### Q: How do I handle urgent issues?
**A**: Mark as "Priority: High", move to ready/ immediately, and notify team. For hotfixes, can go directly to wip/.

### Q: Should I delete completed issues?
**A**: No! Move to `done/` folder for historical reference.

### Q: What about issues that are partially complete?
**A**: Keep in WIP with progress notes. Update checklist as you go.

### Q: When should I use review/ vs going straight to done/?
**A**: Use review/ for significant changes requiring peer review. Small fixes can go directly to done/ after self-review.
