# Archive Documentation

This directory contains historical documentation from completed project phases.

## Purpose

Archive documentation serves as:
- Historical reference for completed work
- Learning resource for understanding project evolution
- Audit trail for decision-making
- Context for future planning

## Structure

### phase-0/ - Web Client Control Panel
Archived documentation from Phase 0 (Web Client implementation)
- Completion reports
- Issue summaries
- Planning matrices from Client module

### phase-1/ - Foundation & Integration
Archived documentation from Phase 1 (TaskManager Integration & Module Infrastructure)
- Batch completion summaries
- Infrastructure setup reports
- Integration planning documents

### phase-2/ - Source Module Implementations
Archived documentation from ongoing Phase 2
- Batch-specific completion reports
- Module implementation summaries
- (Will accumulate as Phase 2 progresses)

## Document Lifecycle

Documents are moved to archive when:
1. Phase or batch is complete
2. Planning document is superseded by updated version
3. Information is integrated into main documentation
4. Historical context is valuable but document is no longer active

## Active Documentation

For current planning and development status, see:
- [DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md](../../../DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md) - Unified development plan
- [_meta/issues/ROADMAP.md](../../issues/ROADMAP.md) - Long-term roadmap
- [_meta/issues/INDEX.md](../../issues/INDEX.md) - Current issue tracking

## Maintenance

- Archive documents are **read-only**
- Do not modify archived documents
- Reference archived docs for historical context only
- Current plans supersede archived plans
