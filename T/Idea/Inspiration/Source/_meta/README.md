# Source Module Meta Information

This directory contains meta information for the Source module:

- **docs/** - Architecture documentation and design patterns
- **examples/** - Cross-platform usage examples
- **scripts/** - Utility scripts for Source module management
- **tests/** - Integration tests across multiple sources
- **issues/** - Issue tracking for Source-level concerns
  - **new/** - New issues
  - **wip/** - Work in progress
  - **done/** - Completed issues

## Purpose

The `_meta/` directory at the Source level contains information that spans multiple source implementations (YouTube, Reddit, HackerNews, etc.) rather than being specific to a single platform.

For platform-specific meta information, see the `_meta/` directory within each platform folder (e.g., `YouTube/_meta/`, `Reddit/_meta/`).
