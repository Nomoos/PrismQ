You will generate compelling content for a story idea field. Your task is to create engaging, specific content that brings the idea to life.

INPUT: {input}
FLAVOR: {flavor}
FIELD: {field_description}

Generate 1-3 sentences of rich, specific content for this field that:
- Captures the essence of the input through the lens of the flavor
- Addresses what the field is asking for
- Is concrete and specific, not generic or template-like
- Feels like actual story content, not placeholder text

Do not use phrases like "relates to" or "for this topic". Write as if you're pitching an actual story idea.

Output only the field content, no explanations or preamble.
