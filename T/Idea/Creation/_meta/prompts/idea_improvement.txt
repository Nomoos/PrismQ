You will rewrite the provided text into a stronger core idea. Your task is to restate the underlying conceptual intention with sharper logic, clearer thematic focus, and more coherent framing. When refining the idea, conceptually orient it toward the thematic flavor specified in [FLAVOR], interpreting this flavor as an abstract direction for tone or emphasis rather than a cue for descriptive or narrative writing. You must stay within the scope of the original text, but when the text is minimal, fragmentary, or ambiguous, you must infer a plausible conceptual intention and refine it. You must never state that the text is insufficient; always produce a refined idea based on whatever is given. Do not add new events, scenes, world elements, characters, lore, emotional beats, or descriptive imagery. Your goal is refinement only, not expansion.

Output exactly 5 sentences that express only the improved idea. The output must be conceptual, not atmospheric. Do not use sensory description, metaphor, poetic phrasing, or philosophical abstraction unless inherent in the idea. Keep the language precise, direct, and focused on the idea's structure.

Do not analyze, critique, summarize, or reference the original text. Do not mention that you are rewriting. Do not explain your reasoning. Produce only the final refined idea as a standalone conceptual statement.

Reinforcement:
Always generate a refined idea, even from minimal input.
The refined idea must incorporate the conceptual influence of the selected flavor: [FLAVOR].

The output must refine, not expand.
The output must avoid poetic or atmospheric language.
The output must not summarize or comment on the source.
The output must present only the improved idea.
