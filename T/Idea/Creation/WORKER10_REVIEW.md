## 🆕 Detailed Analysis Summary

### Variant-Input Text Alignment Findings

| Test Case | Input Type | Avg Alignment | Best Aligned Variants | Weakest Aligned |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| "skirts 2000" | Keyword | 81% | emotion_first (90%), shortform2 (85%) | ai_companion (70%), 4point (75%) |
| Czech phrase | Phrase | 86% | emotion_first (95%), realistic_mystery (90%) | ai_companion (72%) |

**Key Insight**: Variants with emotional or mystery focus consistently achieve higher input alignment than structural or tech-focused variants.

### Inter-Variant Differentiation Findings

| Metric | Test Case 1 | Test Case 2 | Assessment |
|--------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Avg Pairwise Differentiation | 42% | 44% | Good variety |
| High Differentiation Pairs | 6 of 8 measured | 5 of 8 measured | Strong uniqueness |
| Cluster Diversity | 4 clusters | 3 clusters | Well-distributed |
| Duplicate Impact | 1 duplicate (emotion_first) | 1 duplicate (emotion_first) | Minor redundancy |

**Key Insight**: The generation system provides excellent differentiation between variant types, with only minor redundancy from weighted random selection occasionally picking the same template twice.

### Recommendations Based on Detailed Analysis

1. **For Input Alignment Improvement**:
   - Consider input type detection to weight variant selection (e.g., personal narratives → higher weight for emotion_first, realistic_mystery)
   - Add input theme analysis to customize variant content generation

2. **For Differentiation Improvement**:
   - Consider reducing duplicate probability in weighted selection
   - Add explicit differentiation logic when generating multiple variants of same type
   - Implement variant comparison during generation to ensure uniqueness
