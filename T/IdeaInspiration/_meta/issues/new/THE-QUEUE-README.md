## 🔑 Key Findings

### Why SQLite Over MySQL/PostgreSQL/Redis? ✅

**Question**: "Would it be better to have local MySQL or another database?"

**Answer**: **No. SQLite is the optimal choice.**

See **[Database Comparison](./Infrastructure_DevOps/DATABASE-COMPARISON-SQLITE-VS-ALTERNATIVES.md)** for full analysis, **[Decision Tree](./Infrastructure_DevOps/DATABASE-DECISION-TREE.md)** for visual guide, or **[FAQ](./Infrastructure_DevOps/FAQ-DATABASE-CHOICE.md)** for quick answers.

**Pros**:
- ✅ Zero infrastructure (no Redis, RabbitMQ, MySQL server)
- ✅ Single file database on local SSD
- ✅ ACID guarantees (same as MySQL/PostgreSQL)
- ✅ Windows-native support
- ✅ SQL-queryable metrics
- ✅ Simple backup and migration
- ✅ Perfect for 200-500 tasks/min workload
- ✅ Matches "simple architecture" principle

**Cons**:
- ⚠️ Single writer (~1000 tasks/min limit)
- ⚠️ Requires periodic maintenance (VACUUM)
- ⚠️ Windows file locking differences

**Why Not MySQL/PostgreSQL?**:
- ❌ Requires separate server process (complexity)
- ❌ Uses 150-500MB RAM just for server (overhead)
- ❌ Need to manage authentication, ports, networking
- ❌ Over-engineering for single-host, moderate workload

**Why Not Redis?**:
- ❌ In-memory first (data lost on crash unless configured)
- ❌ No SQL (limited observability)
- ❌ Speed not needed (we need 200-500/min, not 50k+/min)

**Verdict**: **SQLite RECOMMENDED** - Fits project requirements perfectly

**Upgrade Path**: Can migrate to PostgreSQL when throughput exceeds 800-1000 tasks/min

### Scheduling Strategies Explained

| Strategy | Use Case | Fairness | Starvation Risk |
|----------|----------|----------|-----------------|
| **FIFO** | Background jobs | High | Low |
| **LIFO** | User actions | Low | High (old tasks) |
| **Priority** | Time-sensitive | None | High (low priority) |
| **Weighted Random** | Load balancing | Medium | Low |

**Implementation**: All 4 supported, configurable per worker

### Best Practices (from Research)

**Critical** ✅:
1. Use WAL mode (30ms → <1ms transactions)
2. Set `busy_timeout = 5000` (handle SQLITE_BUSY)
3. Use IMMEDIATE transactions (atomic claiming)
4. Index on (status, priority, run_after_utc)
5. Batch operations when possible

**Important** ⚠️:
6. Manual checkpointing for high load
7. One connection per process
8. Regular VACUUM or auto_vacuum
9. Parameterized queries only
10. Local SSD only (never network)

## 🎪 Parallelization Strategy

### Maximum Efficiency
- **Phase 1**: 3 workers in parallel
- **Phase 2**: 5 workers in parallel
- **Phase 3**: 3 workers in parallel

### Minimal Conflicts
- Each worker owns distinct code areas
- Only Worker 10 touches existing code
- Clear interfaces prevent integration issues

### Flexible Staffing
- Full-time: Workers 1, 3, 7 (critical path)
- Part-time: Workers 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10
- As needed: Worker 08 (documentation)

## 🚀 Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Based On |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Throughput** | 200-500 tasks/min | Research + workload estimate |
| **Claim Latency** | <10ms (P95) | Benchmarking target |
| **Enqueue Latency** | <5ms (P95) | Client responsiveness |
| **SQLITE_BUSY Rate** | <2% | Acceptable contention |
| **Concurrent Workers** | 4-8 | Research findings |
| **Test Coverage** | >80% | Quality standard |

---

## 🔄 Integration Plan

### With BackgroundTaskManager
```python
# Current (in-memory)
task_manager = BackgroundTaskManager(registry)
task_manager.start_task(run, coroutine)

# Future (SQLite queue)
queue = QueueDatabase("C:/Data/PrismQ/queue/queue.db")
task_manager = BackgroundTaskManager(registry, queue=queue)
task_manager.start_task(run, coroutine)  # Same API!
```

**Strategy**: Maintain API compatibility, gradual migration

### Migration Path
1. **Parallel**: Deploy queue alongside existing system
2. **Gradual**: Route new tasks to queue, keep old tasks in-memory
3. **Full**: Migrate all tasks to queue
4. **Optimize**: Tune based on production metrics
