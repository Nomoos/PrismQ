## Archival Policy

Documents are archived when they:
1. Have completed their purpose (e.g., planning is done, issue is resolved)
2. Are no longer actively referenced
3. Should be preserved for historical context
4. Would clutter active directories

Active references are updated to point to archived locations when needed.
