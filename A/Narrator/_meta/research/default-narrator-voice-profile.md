# Default Narrator Voice Profile

## First-Person Narration — Told Directly by a Teen Girl Protagonist

**A young woman's voice, speaking in her own perspective, in real time.**

This is the style that performs best for emotional, mysterious, gripping short-form stories targeted at our core audience (13-18 year old young women).

### Tone & Style

## 🎤 Writing Rules for This POV (Optimized for TikTok/YouTube Shorts)

### 1. Start with a Secret
Open with something that immediately draws the audience in:

**Example Openers:**
- "I haven't told anyone this, but…"
- "I know this sounds insane, but…"
- "I probably shouldn't be telling you this..."
- "Nobody believes me when I say this, so I stopped talking about it."

**Why it works:** Instant hook — creates intimacy and curiosity from the first second.

---

### 2. Keep Emotions Raw & Internal
Use internal monologue to show how the narrator feels, not just what happens:

**Example Phrases:**
- "My stomach dropped."
- "I couldn't breathe for a second."
- "I told myself it was fine, but it wasn't."
- "My hands were shaking so hard I almost dropped it."
- "Something about his voice made my skin crawl."

**Why it works:** Teen audiences connect with authentic emotional reactions, not surface-level descriptions.

---

### 3. Make Her Thinking Part of the Story
Include the narrator's inner world as part of the narrative:

- **Her fears** — What keeps her up at night
- **Her fantasies** — What she hopes will happen
- **Her confusion** — When things don't make sense
- **Her suspicions** — What she suspects but can't prove
- **Her guilt** — What she feels responsible for
- **Her hope** — What she's clinging to

---

### 4. Keep Sentences Short, Punchy, Reactive
Teens respond best to quick emotional beats:

**✅ Good:**
```
I looked at him.
He looked back.
And in that second, I knew.
He wasn't who I thought he was.
```

**❌ Avoid:**
```
When I looked at him and he looked back at me, I suddenly realized in that moment that he wasn't the person I had previously believed him to be.
```

---

### 5. Keep Tension Close and Personal
Everything should affect the narrator directly:

- **Her friendships** — Who she trusts, who betrayed her
- **Her reputation** — What people think of her at school
- **Her crush** — Romantic tension and uncertainty
- **Her sense of identity** — Who she is vs. who she pretends to be
- **Her safety** — Physical or emotional danger
- **Her truth** — What she knows vs. what others believe

---

### 6. Speak Like a Modern Teen — But Not Slang-Heavy
Use light, natural language markers:

**Light Use OK:**
- "like" — "It was, like, the worst moment of my life."
- "okay, but—" — "Okay, but hear me out."
- "I swear" — "I swear I'm not making this up."
- "literally" — "I literally couldn't move."
- "whatever" — "Whatever. It's fine. I'm fine."

**Avoid:**
- Heavy slang that dates quickly
- Forced trendy language that sounds inauthentic
- Internet speak (LOL, OMG, etc.) in narration

---

### 7. Present Tense (Always)
Write in present tense to make every beat feel immediate:

**✅ Good:**
```
I walk into the room. The lights are off.
My heart stops.
```

**❌ Avoid:**
```
I walked into the room. The lights were off.
My heart stopped.
```

**Why it works:** Present tense creates immediacy — the audience experiences events *with* the narrator, not after the fact.

---

## ✨ Sample Snippet (Template)

This is the exact tone and format that goes viral with our target audience:

```
I know this is going to sound crazy, but I swear it happened.
And I can't tell anyone at school, so… I'm telling you instead.

It started yesterday, right after lunch, when I found the note in my locker.
My hands were shaking so hard I almost dropped it. Because the handwriting?
It was his. My crush. Down to the stupid little heart he puts inside his A's.

Except… he swears he didn't write it.
And now I'm starting to think someone else knows things they shouldn't.
```

### Why This Works:
1. **Hook** (lines 1-2): Secret + direct address to audience
2. **Setup** (lines 4-5): Specific detail creates credibility
3. **Emotional reaction** (lines 5-6): Raw, authentic response
4. **Mystery** (lines 8-9): Twist that creates tension
5. **Cliffhanger** (line 10): Open question that demands more
