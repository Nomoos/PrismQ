# Skeleton

**Workflow Stage: Idea Development Phase**

## Overview

The **Skeleton** stage represents the phase where the Outline is refined into a basic structural framework. This stage creates a bare-bones version of the content that shows the essential structure without full detail.

## Position in Workflow

```
IdeaInspiration → Idea → Outline → [Skeleton] → Title → Script
```

## Purpose

Create a skeletal framework that establishes the core structure and flow of the content. The skeleton provides:

- Basic narrative structure
- Essential story beats
- Key transitional phrases
- Framework for expansion
- Timing and pacing markers

## Key Activities

1. **Distill Structure** - Reduce the outline to essential structural elements
2. **Define Story Beats** - Identify critical moments and transitions
3. **Establish Pacing** - Determine rhythm and tempo of content delivery
4. **Create Framework** - Build expandable structure for script development
5. **Set Markers** - Place timing and emotional beat markers

## Deliverables

- Skeletal content structure
- Story beat map
- Pacing guide
- Expandable framework template

## Example Skeleton Format

```
Hook → Context → Problem → Investigation → Revelation → Resolution
```

or

```
Intro (0:00-0:30) → Setup (0:30-2:00) → Development (2:00-8:00) → 
Climax (8:00-10:00) → Conclusion (10:00-12:00)
```

## Transition Criteria

An Idea moves from Skeleton stage when:
- ✅ Core structure is defined and stable
- ✅ Story beats are identified
- ✅ Pacing markers are in place
- ✅ Framework is ready for script expansion
