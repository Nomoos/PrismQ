# VoiceoverReview

**Workflow Stage: Voiceover Production Phase - Quality Review**

## Overview

The **VoiceoverReview** stage represents the audio quality review phase where voiceover recordings are evaluated and refined.

## Position in Workflow

```
Voiceover → [VoiceoverReview] → VoiceoverApproved → ScenePlanning
```

## Purpose

Ensure voiceover quality meets production standards before final approval. This stage focuses on:

- Performance quality evaluation
- Technical audio quality check
- Pacing and timing verification
- Emotional delivery assessment
- Correction identification

## Key Activities

1. **Listen Review** - Evaluate complete audio performance
2. **Check Quality** - Verify technical audio standards
3. **Assess Performance** - Evaluate emotional delivery and engagement
4. **Identify Issues** - Note problems requiring correction
5. **Request Revisions** - Specify needed improvements

## Review Criteria

### Performance Assessment
- Clarity and articulation
- Emotional authenticity
- Energy and engagement
- Pacing appropriateness
- Tone consistency
- Script adherence

### Technical Quality
- Audio clarity (no distortion)
- Volume consistency
- Noise floor acceptability
- Breath control
- Editing clean-up needs
- Format compliance

### Timing & Pacing
- Target duration compliance
- Section timing accuracy
- Pause appropriateness
- Overall flow
- Tempo variations

## Review Process

1. **First Listen** - Experience audio as audience would
2. **Script Comparison** - Verify accuracy against script
3. **Technical Analysis** - Check audio quality metrics
4. **Performance Evaluation** - Assess delivery effectiveness
5. **Document Feedback** - Create detailed revision notes

## Common Issues

### Performance Issues
- Monotone delivery
- Inconsistent energy
- Unclear articulation
- Inappropriate emotion
- Rushed or slow pacing

### Technical Issues
- Background noise
- Volume inconsistencies
- Distortion or clipping
- Poor breath control
- Audio artifacts

### Timing Issues
- Too long or too short
- Awkward pauses
- Rushed sections
- Pacing inconsistency

## Revision Types

### Minor Revisions
- Pickup lines (specific sections)
- Pronunciation corrections
- Emphasis adjustments
- Pause modifications
- Volume balance

### Major Revisions
- Complete re-recording
- Different performance direction
- Alternative voice selection
- Significant timing changes

## Deliverables

- Review feedback document
- Timestamp-specific notes
- Revision request list
- Performance assessment
- Technical quality report

## Quality Checkpoints

Before moving to VoiceoverApproved:
- [ ] Performance is engaging and authentic
- [ ] Technical quality meets standards
- [ ] Timing is within acceptable range
- [ ] All script content is accurate
- [ ] Emotional delivery is appropriate
- [ ] No technical artifacts
- [ ] Consistent throughout

## Transition Criteria

Voiceover moves to Approved stage when:
- ✅ All review criteria are met
- ✅ No critical issues remain
- ✅ Performance quality is excellent
- ✅ Technical standards achieved
- ✅ Timing is acceptable
- ✅ Stakeholder approval received
